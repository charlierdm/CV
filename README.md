A creative and ambitious Full Stack Developer looking for a role to extend and consolidate my programming knowledge, as well as grow as a person and engineer.
I aim to bring personal qualities that will add to a healthy team dynamic and positive working enviornment. Clear communication and being mindful are key values at the forefront of my focus.

Since February 2021, I have been studying at Makers Academy, an intensive programming bootcamp in which I have learned so many new skills regarding teamwork and coding. For example, for my final project [Marble](https://github.com/charlierdm/Marble), we created an invisible habit tracking app using React Native, an entirely new framework for us all in the space of 2 weeks. Within the Emotional Intelligence workshops at Makers, I have developed many skills that lend towards effective teamwork, as well as being there for my team both emotionally and technically. <strong>The course experience has embedded in me the ability to learn anything and I am very excited to continue that journey.</strong>

# Skills 

  

### Adaptability 

My journey up until now has been a case of adapting from one environment to another. I spent the past 2 years within in a small community of expat teachers that became like family whilst living in South Korea. This experience has left me feeling capable of adapting to anything and being able to thrive.  

### Communication 

I have a background in Journalism and Teaching, naturally communication has been a vital part of both. I am always practicing good, attentive listening and feel this is key for working with others. Marshall B. Rosenbergs book ‘Nonviolent Communication’ is a big influence on my approach to teamwork. 

### Enthusiasm 

I approach life with curiosity and enthusiasm and feel these qualities lend themselves to being a great team member and programmer. 

### Focus 

I had the goal of saving enough whilst teaching to be able to pursue my educational goals and have successfully done that by keeping my longer-term goals in mind and shaping my choices and lifestyle to support that ambition. This took self-disciple and the ability to envision what it would take to achieve my goal, ultimately, focus.
  

## Experience 

  

### English Language Teacher - GEM Academy (South Korea, January ‘19 - January ‘20)   

I taught and ran my own curriculum to students aged between 5 and 16 at the private academy. I trained a group of students for the Cambridge speaking and written competition held in Seoul.  

The greatest lesson from my time spent teaching in Korea is the importance of listening. 

  

### English Language Teacher – Chungnam Education Office (South Korea, November ‘17 - December ‘18)   

For my first year in South Korea, I taught English language at two public schools. All of my students were elementary level and I was involved in organizing events and activity days for the students. 

 

### Team Leader/Market Research Analyst – One Radar (Brighton, U.K April ‘14 – February ‘17)
