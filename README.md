A creative and ambitious Full Stack Developer looking for a role to extend my programming knowledge, as well as grow as a person and engineer.
I aim to bring personal qualities that will add to a healthy team dynamic and positive working enviornment. Clear communication and being mindful are key values at the forefront of my focus. Problem solving and attention to detail are key attributes that lend themselves to my coding. 

Since February 2021, I have been studying at Makers Academy, an intensive programming bootcamp in which I have learned so many new skills regarding teamwork and coding. For example, for my final project [Marble](https://github.com/charlierdm/Marble), we created an invisible habit tracking app using React Native, an entirely new framework for us all in the space of 2 weeks. Within the Emotional Intelligence workshops at Makers, I have developed many skills that lend towards effective teamwork, as well as being there for my team both emotionally and technically. <strong>The course experience has embedded in me the ability to learn anything and I am very excited to continue that journey.</strong>

# Skills 

  

### Adaptability 

My journey up until now has been a case of adapting from one environment to another. I spent the past 2 years within in a small community of expat teachers that became like family whilst living in South Korea. This experience has left me feeling capable of adapting to anything and being able to thrive.  

* I managed to use both my emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills to integrate into another culture and teach individuals of various ages and abilities. 

### Communication 

I have a background in Journalism and Teaching, naturally communication has been a vital part of both. I am always practicing good, attentive listening and feel this is key for working with others. Marshall B. Rosenbergs book ‘Nonviolent Communication’ is a big influence on my approach to teamwork. 

* A large part of my teaching role was planning my lessons in accordance with the national curriculum. I would have to relay what I was creating through and English to Korean translator which required great patience and attentiveness.

### Enthusiasm 

I approach life with curiosity and enthusiasm and feel these qualities lend themselves to being a great team member and programmer.

* As a teacher, there is an element of performance. To keep engagement and interest in your classes - I had to approach each lesson with a great deal of enthusiasm. 

### Focus 

I had the goal of saving enough whilst teaching to be able to pursue my educational goals and have successfully done that by keeping my longer-term goals in mind and shaping my choices and lifestyle to support that ambition. This took self-disciple and the ability to envision what it would take to achieve my goal, ultimately, focus.

* I have spent the past 6 months working daily to refine my programming process with full commitment and clear intent.
