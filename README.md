## Charlie Davis-Miller 

  

A creative and ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer looking for a role in a challenging new environment, to enhance my developer skillset, as well as grow as an engineer and person. 

I aim to bring personal qualities to the table that will add to a healthy team dynamic and I am intent on learning everything I can within the programming sphere.  

Since February 2021, I have been studying at Makers Academy, a developer bootcamp in which I’ve been learning software development through a number of projects such as (project link goes here). I have spent the past 2 years living and teaching in South Korea and feel the experience has made me highly adaptable and resilient.

## Experience 

  

### English Language Teacher - GEM Academy (South Korea, January ‘19 - January ‘20)   

I taught and ran my own curriculum to students aged between 5 and 16 at the private academy. I trained a group of students for the Cambridge speaking and written competition held in Seoul.  

The greatest lesson from my time spent teaching in Korea is the importance of listening. 

  

### English Language Teacher – Chungnam Education Office (South Korea, November ‘17 - December ‘18)   

For my first year in South Korea, I taught English language at two public schools. All of my students were elementary level and I was involved in organizing events and activity days for the students. 

 

### Team Leader/Market Research Analyst – One Radar (Brighton, U.K April ‘14 – February ‘17) 

 

I began as a market research analyst, contacting International Companies regarding IT and HR services. After several months I was promoted to Team Leader, in which I managed a team of 7 staff, delegating tasks to ensure meeting targets and delivering training on the internal CRM system.

  

## Skills 

  

### Adaptability 

My journey up until now has been a case of adapting from one environment to another. I spent the past 2 years within in a small community of expat teachers that became like family whilst living in South Korea. This experience has left me feeling capable of adapting to anything and being able to thrive.  

### Communication 

With my background in both Journalism and Education, there has always been an emphasis on good communication for me. I am always practicing good, attentive listening and feel this is key for working with others as well as being as present as possible for any given scenario. Marshall B. Rosenbergs ‘Nonviolent Communication’ is a big influence. 

### Enthusiasm 

I approach life with curiosity and enthusiasm. These are crucial components that enable me to be the developer that I am today.

### Focus 

I had the goal of saving enough whilst teaching to be able to pursue my educational goals and have successfully done that by keeping my longer-term goals in mind and shaping my choices and lifestyle to support that ambition. This took self-disciple and the ability to envision what it would take to achieve my goal, ultimately, focus.
