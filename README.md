A creative and ambitious Full Stack Developer with a background in Education, looking for a role to extend my programming knowledge, as well as grow as a person and engineer. Clear communication and being mindful are key values at the forefront of my focus to create a healthy team dynamic. Problem solving and attention to detail are key attributes that lend themselves to my coding. Having completed the 16 week Makers Academy bootcamp, I have been left with a real passion for learning and embracing new technologies and improving my process. <strong>The course experience has embedded in me the ability to learn anything and I am very excited to continue that journey.</strong>

| [Marble](https://github.com/charlierdm/Marble)       | <strong>An app for visualising invisible habits.</strong> This was my first time creating a mobile app which meant we developed many new skills such as debugging via an android emulator and figuring out how to combine our front end to our cloud based back end.  | React Native, Firebase | 
| [NoteApp](https://github.com/charlierdm/noteApp)   | <strong>A single page web app for developers to take notes.</strong> The challenge was to write a SPA webapp with no frameworks which meant learning lots of new JavaScript techniques to solve problems such as page reloads and navigation.  | Vanilla JavaScript  | 
| [AceBook](https://github.com/charlierdm/Acebook)   | <strong>A Social Media web app for users to communicate on.</strong> This was my first time using a fully featured framework and with a steep learning curve. We managed to overcome the initial difficulty by studying individually, then as a group to share knowledge.    | Ruby on Rails       |

# Skills 

  

### Adaptability 

My journey up until now has been a case of adapting from one environment to another. I spent the past 2 years within in a small community of expat teachers that became like family whilst living in South Korea. This experience has left me feeling capable of adapting to anything and being able to thrive.  

* I managed to use both my emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills to integrate into another culture and teach individuals of various ages and abilities. The result of this was seeing students that started with no English speaking/reading skills at all developing the skills to say basic phrases and expressions.

### Meaningful Communication 

I have a background in Journalism and Teaching, naturally communication has been a vital part of both. I am always practicing good, attentive listening and feel this is key for working with others. Marshall B. Rosenbergs book ‘Nonviolent Communication’ is a big influence on my approach to teamwork as I value creating a space for others to be heard and listened to as well as expressing myself with as much clarity as possible.

* I made sure that during each standup on our group project at Makers Academy, that we held an emotional check in - to create a space where each team member can speak openly about how they are thinking or feeling. Building understanding of how the team was managing the project and difficulties of learning a new framework helped determine what tasks we would each focus on for the day.  

### Determination

I'm a focused, goal orientated individual. I value regular reflection and daily practices to help me keep clear and consistent. For example, I read about Stoicism regularly as I find it helps to remind me of what I hold important in life and clarify my values. I meditate daily so that I can focus on what I want to achieve each day and contribute well to whatever task I am given. 

* I had the goal of saving enough whilst teaching to be able to persue studying at Makers Academy. I achieved this by keeping my longer-term goals in mind and shaping my choices and lifestyle to support that ambition. This took self-disciple and the ability to envision what it would take to achieve my goal.
